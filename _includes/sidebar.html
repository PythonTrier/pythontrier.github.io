    <h2>Upcoming Meets</h2>

    <p>
      With rare exception PythonTrier meets on the second Tuesday of every month.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Currently, we do not have a meeting space and are looking for a new location. Until we find something suitable,
      please check the individual meetups for the most updated information on where we're meeting that month.

    If you have a favourite package, pet project, or topic that you could present during a meet, then please consider
