Here we continue our look into Pandas. I created a profit calculator that merged data frames gathered from online sources
and merged them with a data frame that I set up offline for offline analysis. The datasets used in these slides can be
found at the [Python Trier GitHub](https://github.com/PythonTrier/DataSets). Check it out and give it a try yourself.
