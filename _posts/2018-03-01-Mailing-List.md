Sorry all. We've fallen a little behind in posting content from our meetups. There will be some coming soon. In 
the mean time, we have a new mailing list! The 
[Luxembourg and Greater Region community mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mm3/mailman3/lists/luxembourg.python.org/)
focuses on Luxembourg, Trier, and the surrounding area. If you would like to keep up on what's new in our group or you 
would like to join the conversation, go ahead and sign up. With time we hope to see many more individuals as well as 
other local groups join. Happy coding!
