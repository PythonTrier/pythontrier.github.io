There are a few conferences in Europe over the next year, but the next two are right here in Germany. This weekend is
the PythonCamp in Cologne, though it's probably a little late if you haven't already made plans to go.  There's still an
opportunity to checkout [PyConWeb](https://www.pyconweb.com) in Munich at the end of May. The focus of this conference 
will be web development within the Python ecosystem. Early bird prices are in effect through the 30th of April, after 
which, full prices go in effect. You can find more information on their 
[ticket page](https://ti.to/pymunich/pyconweb-2017?source=homepage). Other conferences are listed on the sidebar of our 
page. As always, if anyone is interested in going, feel free to contact the group through our 
[MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/PythonTrier/) page or join our [Slack](https://PythonTrier.slack.com) channel and we'll 
see if we can coordinate ride-shares with other interested members.
