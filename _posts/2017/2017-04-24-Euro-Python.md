Euro Python 2017 is partnering with different organizations to provide discounted travel to Rimini this July. They've 
partnered with Lufthansa Group (Lufthansa, Swiss, Eurowings, Austrian, and Brussels Airlines) as their preferred airline
partner, offering a 5-10% discount on airfare to Bologna and Florence. You can also get discounted tickets for the 
shuttle that runs from the airport to Rimini. For more details and the codes for the discounts, check out the travel
