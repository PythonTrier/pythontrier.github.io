### Challenge 01
<img src="/images/code.png" alt="Code Challenge" align="left" hspace="5" style="width:180px;">

Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

### Challenge 02

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

### Want to give it a try?

We have a Jupyter notebook where code challenges are presented for the group to try. The link can be found at <https://srv.derpy.ws:55523/tree/Challenges>. There is a password so if you haven’t received it already, please feel free to contact me on MeetUp and I’ll send you the current password.

Past solutions will remain in each challenge notebook. Feel free to add your own solution at any time. Consider commenting your code to help others understand your approach. If you can’t understand why you wrote something after not looking at it for a while, it could probably benefit from a little extra commenting. A few new challenges will be posted every month.
