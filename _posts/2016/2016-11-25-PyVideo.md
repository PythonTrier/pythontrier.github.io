If you've never been to a python event, or you wanted to go but something came up, there is a video repository just for you. [Pyvideo.org](pyvideo.org) is a free volunteer-driven resource which indexes video from events all over the world. You can get a glimpse of what they have already at their [events page](http://pyvideo.org/events.html).

From 2016 alone, they've posted videos to [PyData Berlin](http://pyvideo.org/events/pydata-berlin-2016.html), [PyCon DE](http://pyvideo.org/events/pycon-de-2016.html), [PyCon UK](http://pyvideo.org/events/pycon-uk-2016.html), [PyCon US](http://pyvideo.org/events/pycon-us-2016.html), [DjangoCon Europe](http://pyvideo.org/events/djangocon-europe-2016.html), and many more. Again, they're volunteer driven so, if you're interested in helping out, you can find more information on their [wiki page](https://github.com/pyvideo/pyvideo/wiki/How-to-Volunteer).
