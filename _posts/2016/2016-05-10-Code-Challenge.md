Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Challenge 04

The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?

### Want to give it a try?

We have a Jupyter notebook where code challenges are presented for the group to try. The link can be found at <https://srv.derpy.ws:55523/tree/Challenges>. There is a password so if you haven’t received it already, please feel free to contact me on MeetUp and I’ll send you the current password.

Past solutions will remain in each challenge notebook. Feel free to add your own solution at any time. Consider commenting your code to help others understand your approach. If you can’t understand why you wrote something after not looking at it for a while, it could probably benefit from a little extra commenting. A few new challenges will be posted every month.
